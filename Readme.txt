Hello there!
This is a very basic project as well as my first upload on Github. if you like this  please share this project as much as you can.
this is actually a presettable timer that has following parts:
1) Pic16f72 microcontroller
2) 20Mhz crystal with 2* 22pF capacitors
3) 4 didit 7 segment display
4) 2* pushbuttons 
5) 3* 10k resistors 

this is basically to turn on led for defined time by the user and turn off autmatically after the clock ends. 
You can use this one to control a relay also as per your needs. 
thankyou for visiting.
